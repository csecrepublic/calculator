# Rainbow Calculator
A calculator with basic functionality and a snazzy design.

## Description
This is a calculator with basic functionality, as well as some advanced operations (squares, square roots and powers).

This site was designed using The Odin Project's Calculator project guidelines (linked below). I practiced using event listeners, CSS gradients, JS functions and modularity, and other basic front-end skills.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Issues & ideas
* Optimize for mobile
* Handle multiple "=" presses in a row
* Clear screen after single-number functions (e.g. square or square-root)
* Limit number of digits on screen for answers (currently only limited for user inputs)

## Instructions
No installation required. Just follow this [link to the GitHub Pages site](https://csecrepublic.github.io/calculator/).
